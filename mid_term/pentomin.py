def covers(grid_height, grid_width, pentominoes):
    """
    Given a grid of locations and a list of pentominoes, return True if the given
    arrangement of pentominoes completely covers the board, or False otherwise.  The grid
    should be considered covered if every location from (0, 0) through (grid_height-1,
    grid_width-1) has a part of a pentomino in it, no two pentominoes overlap, and no part
    of any of the given pentominoes extends outside the grid.

    Inputs:
        * grid_height is an integer indicating the height of the grid
        * grid_width is an integer indicating the width of the grid
        * pentominoes is a list of (shape, row, column) tuples, where shape is an
          integer index into the SHAPES array, and row and column represent the location
          in the grid where the (0,0) anchor point of the given shape is placed
    Todo: write a version of covers that computes the same result but operates substantially more efficiently.
     You are welcome to use Ben’s helper functions (you do not need to rewrite them),
     and you may define additional helper functions of your own.
